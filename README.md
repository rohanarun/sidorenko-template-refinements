# Sidorenko: finite-template minimum and a smaller residual bound

An independent, AI-generated research draft prepared with Codex, following OpenAI's *A counterexample to Sidorenko's conjecture*. This repository contains two refinements of its method, proofs, exact certificates, and a reproducible enumeration.

**Scope:** a computer-assisted minimum within a specified finite construction template, and a smaller constant in one counting step. This is **not** a minimum for all Sidorenko counterexamples, a smaller general counterexample, or a verified bound on the full construction's dimension. The results depend on the stated source arguments and, for enumeration completeness, plantri. Mathematical priority and formal verification are not claimed.

## Results and proof ideas

### A 35-vertex minimum within the finite template

The template has distinct triangular faces; every point pair occurs in exactly two faces; each admissible cut partitions the faces into two spanning exposure orders; a probability distribution over cuts crosses every pair with probability at least $1/3$; and incidence color refinement, starting from the two part colors, is discrete.

Each exposure order builds a triangulated polygon containing every point on its boundary. Gluing the two polygons gives a sphere triangulation. Admissible cuts correspond to Hamiltonian cycles in its point graph. Consequently, if $a_e$ is the crossing probability,

$$\sum_{e\ni v}a_e=2.$$

Thus $a_e\ge1/3$ forces every point degree to be at most six. We enumerate all simple sphere triangulations on 4 through 12 points and filter by that condition and discrete incidence refinement:

| Points | All triangulations | Degree at most six | Discrete refinement | Exact obstructions |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 4 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 5 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 6 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 0 |
| 7 | 5 | 5 | 0 | 0 |
| 8 | 14 | 10 | 0 | 0 |
| 9 | 50 | 15 | 1 | 1 |
| 10 | 233 | 30 | 4 | 4 |
| 11 | 1249 | 44 | 12 | 12 |
| 12 | 7595 | 77 | 23 | 23 |

For each surviving graph, the saved nonnegative rational edge weights sum to one and give **every Hamiltonian cycle weight strictly below $1/3$**. Any admissible cut mixture would instead have expected weight at least $1/3$, a contradiction. This excludes arbitrary weighted mixtures, not just three equally weighted cuts.

An independent exact verifier uses Held–Karp dynamic programming, checks 16,941 cycles in aggregate, and obtains a minimum separating margin of $1/75$. The original 13-point, 22-face certificate gives the matching 35-vertex incidence graph. Completeness remains dependent on plantri's enumeration algorithm; the certificates are not Lean proofs.

At 13 points, a further enumeration leaves exactly two feasible isomorphism classes within the finite template. One is the original; the other is a different 35-vertex finite certificate. Both pass the combinatorial and support checks. **The alternative is not claimed as a newly proved counterexample:** its full analytic transfer has not been independently verified.

### Residual constant: 1641 to 1032

The original proof's equality stratum forces zero pair dimension wherever cut coverage exceeds $1/3$. Its published cuts exclude five pairs, leaving only 28 potentially active pairs. This tightens the local dimension caps.

Writing $d=\sum_i k_i-2k\ge1$, the original counting exponent, including the gain, is bounded by

$$-Dd-k^2+2mk-2m+\sum_i\binom{k_i}{2}.$$

The new caps first bound the remainder by 1196. For $d=1$, a convexity bound and 54 exact integer cases improve it to 1032; $d\ge2$ is already covered by the coarser bound. Thus this nondirect residual contribution is

$$O_D(q^{-D+1032})\qquad(D\ge1032).$$

Even dimension **1034**, instead of 1642, suffices for this one step. Earlier residue and transverse thresholds remain required and may dominate. The graph, cuts, and activation laws are unchanged.

## Reproduce

Use Python 3.11 or 3.12:

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -B run_checks.py
```

GitHub Actions runs the same command on pushes and pull requests. Do not enable Python optimization (`-O` or `PYTHONOPTIMIZE`); certificate assertions must remain active. The runner rejects optimized execution.

The full argument is in [proof.tex](proof.tex), which has been compiled successfully with the Codex document editor. No compiled PDF is bundled. The tests supplement the mathematical argument; they are not a formal proof of the original papers or an independent review.

The Sidorenko runner also requires a C compiler (`cc`, or set `CC`) and network access to retrieve one hash-verified original source file. It builds the included unmodified plantri source into ignored `build/`, reruns the enumeration through 13 points, checks the saved certificates independently, verifies the original finite certificate, and recomputes the residual bound from the original published table. Outputs go to `build/`; the saved evidence is preserved.

## Evidence and tests

- [Exact obstruction witnesses](experiments/cut-obstructions/summary.json), [independent minimum check](experiments/minimality-independent.json).
- [Order-13 classification](experiments/order-13-classification-independent.json) and [two feasible certificates](experiments/order-13-cuts/).
- [Residual arithmetic expectations](experiments/residual-expected.json), including every span case.
- [verify_minimality.py](verify_minimality.py) reconstructs faces and refinement separately from the proposal code and optimizes Hamiltonian-cycle weights exactly, without SciPy.
- [check_complex.py](check_complex.py) checks pair multiplicity, connectedness, exposure orders, coverage, refinement, and support intersections. Duplicate-face and incomplete-exposure mutations are rejected.
- A corrupted edge-weight certificate is rejected. Floating-point LP success or failure is never used as the final infeasibility certificate.

To regenerate proposed witnesses, install `requirements-search.txt` and use `certify_cut_obstructions.py --help`. The included optimizer uses SciPy only to suggest rational witnesses; the independent verifier certifies them. `enumerate_triangulations.py` and `search_complex.py` retain the proposal methods for inspection.

Its unmodified C source, manual, [Apache 2.0 license](vendor/plantri/LICENSE-2.0.txt), and [download provenance](vendor/plantri/provenance.json) are included. The saved verification receipt pins the C-source hash.
